I'm a Machine Learning Scientist, former Dental Surgeon (no kidding), and Vanier Scholar of Canada. 

These days
- **Principal Applied Scientist** at [Microsoft](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microsoft/) where I spend most of my Machine Learning cycles.
- As **Chief Technology Officer**, continue to lead the technical team of [Offerland](https://offerland.ca/) which I co-founded in 2019.
- **Teach** Machine Teaching courses in [UBC](http://ubc.ca/), whenever I can.

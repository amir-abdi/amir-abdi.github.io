I'm a Machine Learning Scientist, former Dental Surgeon (no kidding), and Vanier Scholar of Canada. 

What I do these days?
- I am primarily employed as a Principal Applied Scientist at Microsoft where I spend most of my Machine Learning cycles.
- I'm the Co-founder and CTO of [Offerland](https://offerland.ca/) and have been leading its technical team since 2019.
- I teach Machine Teaching in UBC, when I can!
